// QML-facing read-only model wrapping a QVector<Contact> (Task 33), same
// pattern as EmailListModel (see app/mail/EmailListModel.h): owned by
// ContactsController, which is the only writer via setContacts(). One row
// per Contact. primaryEmail/primaryPhone are derived (first entry of
// emails/phones, empty string if none) rather than exposing the full
// nested-entry arrays as roles -- those are the two fields every list row
// and the Mac-style read-only card actually display; the full Contact
// struct (including every email/phone/address entry) is available to QML
// for the edit form via ContactsController::contactAt(uid) instead.
//
// synced role: `!pendingUids.contains(contact.uid)`, where pendingUids is
// supplied by ContactsController::load() from
// ContactSyncRepository::pendingUids() -- the real ground truth for "is
// there a queued create/update/delete for this uid that hasn't
// round-tripped through sync() yet" (see PendingContactChangeDao /
// ContactSyncRepository.cpp's queueCreate/queueUpdate/queueDelete, which
// enqueue there, and sync(), which clears the whole table on success).
// Previously this role used a `rev != 0` proxy on Contact itself, since
// queueCreate() assigns a temp local uid immediately (so `uid.isEmpty()`
// was never a usable test) and Contact had no direct synced/pending field.
// That proxy could not distinguish "queued update not yet pushed" from
// "successfully synced" and depended on the server never returning rev==0
// for a fresh object. Querying the pending table directly has neither
// limitation.
